# Spiroh

Processing app to create guilloche-like images&mdash;similar to a spirograph&mdash;using three layers of repeating circles, with controls over each layer. After creating a design you like, you can export either a PNG or SVG of your design. You can use PNGs to raster engrave with a laser cutter, or the SVG to send to a CNC or pen-plotter (e.g.: AxiDraw)

To run this app you will need Processing (processing.org) and the ControlP5 library (Sketch->Import Library...->Add Library...)

Here are a few examples, including the interface:
